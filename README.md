# JS Emacs

This is my personal config for JavaScript Development in emacs.

It is a stripped out tweaked version of [My Ruby development emacs configuration](https://github.com/StlthyLee/emacs)

I could quite easilt have just bundled the two together but as I'm doing very little Ruby work at the moment I wanted a stripped out cleaner configuration for JS development.
